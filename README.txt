Hi, this is README.

Environment: Mac OS 10.13.6  python2.7.10 

This is an implementation for two inference methods for Propositional Logic and demonstrate them on some example problems. It has two python file, tt_entail.py and resolution.py, the former is for truth-table enumeration method, and the latter is for a resolution-based theorem prover. The program is very easy to operate. First, choose which file to see the solution you want, then enter the number(only the number) of problems(1-6) you want to see. The result is shown as True or False, indicating True or False of the problem. I wrote a while loop so the program can keep going on. 

NOTICE!: if you keep running the program it will become slowly to generate the answer, this is not because my algorithm works slowly, this is because you keep running it. When this happens, you can just close the program completely and open it again to see the answer you want.
